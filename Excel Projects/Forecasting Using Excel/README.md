# Forecasting-using-Excel

In this project, we have date and views of a youtube channel from 06/01/2022 to 01/14/2023. Using 3 different forecast techniques we are predicting the views of this youtube channel for the next 7 days.

The 3 techniques used for forecasting in this project are:

1. Using Forecast function.


2. Forecasting using trendline & R square:

   We can choose the best trendline using highest R2 value from different trendline options available

  What is R square?

  R square is also known as coefficient of determination which measures how well the regression line fits the data. It has value between 0 & 1, higher square means better model 
  performance.

3. Forecasting using forecast sheet:

   In this we method we use Forecast Sheet from Data Tab to forecast values. We can change the forecast end date dynamically and set the confidence interval as per the requirements.
