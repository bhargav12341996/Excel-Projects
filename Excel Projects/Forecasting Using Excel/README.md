  What is R square?

  R square is also known as coefficient of determination which measures how well the regression line fits the data. It has value between 0 & 1, higher square means better model 
  performance.

3. Forecasting using forecast sheet:

   In this we method we use Forecast Sheet from Data Tab to forecast values. We can change the forecast end date dynamically and set the confidence interval as per the requirements.
